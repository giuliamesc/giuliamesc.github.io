Hi everyone, and welcome to my personal website!
<br>
I am Giulia, Master Student in Mathematical Engineering (track in <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/computational-science-and-engineering/'> Computational Science and Engineering</a>) and I am attending a <b>Double Degree</b> Program between EPFL and Politecnico di Milano.
<br>
<br>
In my study path, I have explored several fields; in my Bachelor in <a href='https://www.mate.polimi.it/im/?settore=triennale#ann'> Ingegneria Matematica </a> at Politecnico di Milano, I took courses ranging from theoretical Mathematics to Engineering Subjects, while in my MSc path I am mainly deepening into <b> Mathematical Analysis</b>, <b> Numerical Methods</b> and <b> Machine Learning</b>.
<br>
<br>
Despite the computational focus of my MSc program, I fell in love with the analytical study of <b> Partial Differential Equations</b>; I am deeply fascinated by the way in which Mathematics influences physical phenomena (specially fluid-dynamics), by the possibility of proving results with physical interpretation starting from abstract tools and by the intutions that are behind the most remarkable proofs in Mathematical Analysis.
<br>
<br>
Apart from Mathematics, I am passionate about art 🎨, literature 📚, running 🏃🏻‍♀️, going to the beach 🌊 and eating good food 🍰.
