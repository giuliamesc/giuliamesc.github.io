Project in collaboration with the EPFL <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lastro/">Laboratory of Astrophysics</a> (LASTRO). We developed Machine Learning-based methods for the estimation of the Ionization Rate, to propose an alternative to the demanding classical Radiative Transfer approach.

The work was carried out jointly with Matteo Calaf√† and Paolo Motta.
