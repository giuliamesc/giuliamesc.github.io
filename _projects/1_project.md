For my Semester Project, I worked at the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/amcv/'> Chair of Mathematical Analysis and Calculus of Variations </a>, and deepened into the problem of regularity of solutions to the Euler Equation, one of the main open issues in the field of Partial Differential Equations.
<br>
<br>
I developed in detail two examples sketched in the paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04795'><em> Finite-Time Singularity Formation for C<sup>1,Î±</sup> Solutions to the Incompressible Euler Equations on R<sup>3</sup></em></a> by T.Elgindi (2021), and studied the strategy adopted in the paper to build a self-similar solution with blow-up at a finite time.
