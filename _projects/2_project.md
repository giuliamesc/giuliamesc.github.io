<br>
The Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) approach to Fluid-Dynamics consists in training Neural Networks to reconstruct solutions (pressure, velocity fields) while respecting the physical laws described by Partial Differential Equations.
<br>
<br>
The project involved the implementation of a PINN in stationary and non-stationary test cases: <em>Poiseuille Flow</em>, <em>Lid-Driven Cavity</em> and <em>Coronary Flow</em>.
<br>
<br>
The work was carried out jointly with Luca Sosta.
